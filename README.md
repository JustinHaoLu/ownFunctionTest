#My ownFucntion test directory.

	This is my own testing repository that contains all my learning progress through java.

	Repositorie included has its own function.

	The first repository named "LocalCodingTest" includes all the algorithms using Java that I made to test by myself.
	The second repository named "C_Code" includes the algorithms I made to test something.

	The following are the details:

1.	LocalCodingTest/src/stringReverse:

	A algorithm that can reverse string into new sort;

2.	LocalCodingTest/src/upperString:

	This algorithm can change minner word into upper word, or btw,change upper word into minner word.

3.	2021年10月8日update:

	Create a new directory named"C_Code".

	This directory contains my own test using C code.

	It includes two directories ".vscode" and "excerice".

	The ".vscode" has two documents:"launch.json" and "tasks.json".

	launch.json has the function that it can build the codes while launch.json can debug the C documents.
  
	Besides, there is another directory in C_Code named "excerice".

	This directory also has two son branches:"bin" and others.

	The bin directory contains the C code which has been debuged.

	So the lefting documents are the C code documents that has its own function.

	You can see the details at every C code documents.
